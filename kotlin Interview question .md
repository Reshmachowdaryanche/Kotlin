## 1. How does Kotlin work on Android?

Just like Java, Kotlin code is compiled into **Java bytecode**. When you write Kotlin code in a file such as `Main.kt`, the Kotlin compiler compiles it into a class file named `MainKt.class` (for top-level functions) and generates the corresponding bytecode.

During the Android build process, this bytecode is converted into **DEX (Dalvik Executable)** bytecode, which is then executed by the **Android Runtime (ART)**. Since Kotlin is fully interoperable with Java, it can seamlessly use all Java libraries and Android APIs.
